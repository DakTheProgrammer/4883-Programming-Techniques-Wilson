## Assignment 3 - Presentation UVA: 11988

### Approach to the problem:

- My first approach to this problem was that queues were definitely going to be needed.
- So due to this I started to read the problem and look at the input/output to see what the brackets really meant for the problem.
- Then once I realized how Beiju text worked I started to actually solve the problem.

### Language used:

- C++.

### Problem solving paradigm:

- brute force of just putting things on the front and back of the queue based on the leading [ or ]

### Data structures chosen:

- I chose a double-ended stack for this problem.
- The reasons being:
    - The text was either going to be in the front of the queue or back of the queue based on the direction on the bracket.
    - It just seemed like the easier option for coding the problem.
    - I felt it would probably be a lot faster to do it that way then reorganizing different stacks.

### Did speed factor in to previous choices:

- It defensibly wasn't the biggest factor for me in this problem in that I could only think of one way to solve it.
- Also most of the thought for speed when programing this was how can I as the programer program this in the shortest time possible and I didn't really consider speed.

### Could any speed ups be included but were not:

- I feel like there is probably a way to combine some of my if statements or make them shorter.
- also there might be a better data structure for this that I didn't consider.
